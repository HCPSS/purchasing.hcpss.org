<h2>Purchasing Department Mission Statement</h2>

<p>The Purchasing Department strives to serve and support the educational

the best value, quality, and timely delivery while maintaining compliance with
state and local laws, regulations, and HCPSS policies. Minority participation is
highly encouraged in all solicitations and the Purchasing department is
